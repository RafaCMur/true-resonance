# Privacy Policy – True Resonance

Our privacy policy is simple:

True Resonance **does not collect, store, or share any personal data**.  
All pitch-shifting is performed locally in your browser (Web Audio API).

**Permissions used**
`activeTab`, `scripting`, `storage`, and access to `*.youtube.com` are needed only to inject the audio-processing code and remember your last-selected frequency.

**Third-party links**
A voluntary “Donate” button opens PayPal / Ko-fi in a separate tab; any information you enter there is handled solely by that service.

Bundled open-source libraries (e.g. SoundTouch – LGPL 2.1) run entirely offline and transmit no data.
