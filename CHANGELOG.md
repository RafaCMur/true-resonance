# CHANGELOG

## [1.0.2] - 2025-07-08

### Changed

- Soundtouch is only connected when pitch mode is selected. When rate mode is selected, it should not be connected. This saves resources.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-07-08

### Fixed

- When entering a youtube video with the extension disabled, and then enabling it, the video wasn't tuned properly in pitch mode.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-07-08

- Initial release
